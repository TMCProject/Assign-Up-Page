                I decided to undertake BSc (Honours) in Computer Systems and quickly realised that I would need help, as
                I changed from senior school education structure to a University self-disciplined structure – I was a
                bit
                overwhelmed”, so I contacted Assign Up to help me with my assignments.

                The process was quick and simple, to engage a knowledgeable writer in my field and the assignments were
                produced to a very high standard within the agreed time frame and price. All the assignment work was
                unique and fresh, with no risk of duplication.

                I used Assign Up for all my assignments and final year thesis.

                me
                with assignments that helped give me breathing space for the rest of the course. Assign Up from the
                start
                were professional, understanding and knowledgably, which enabled me to relax - they really were my

                  Scammers create untold misery for the honest person; so to avoid internet scams, our policies are
                  restricted to validating each client. We will validate each client’s information by ensuring the order
                  form details match the payment details. We will also check an IP address to validate if it matches
                  with the address of the client that they entered. If any client enters payment details different to
                  that of the order form, then we will need photo/screenshot of government issued ID card and the front
                  side of the credit card, to validate that the customer is not a scammer. If it is the case that the
                  client fails to provide documentation for validation, then Assign Up will cancel the order without
                  further notice.

                  At Assign Up we take confidentiality and privacy very seriously and as a result we only collect the
                  data required to fulfil client orders. All information is kept private and secure; this is personal
                  contact details, emails and payment details which could reveal the identity of the client. This
                  information will not be shared with unauthorised staff of Assign Up, or any third party at any
                  cost.<br><br>
                  Assign Up follows three golden principles regarding confidentiality / privacy as follows;<br><br>
                  1. We do not share client information with the writer assigned to the client. To get in touch with a
                  writer when he /or she is offline send a query to our support team at <b>info@assignup.ie</b><br>
                  2. We do not share your login details with your college, university, or with your assigned writer and
                  we also encourage all our clients not to share the personal login details to our client page with
                  anyone else.<br>
                  3. As a client you will not require to interact with the writer assigned to you for any payment
                  requests, these will always be done through our payment portal, to the agreed terms. Should you be
                  asked then we request to be informed immediately and another writer will be assigned to you for the
                  completion of the assignment. <br><br>
                  Pages on our website like our “order now” and “contact us” do require identity details like, email
                  address, home address, and phone number, and will remain for the duration of the completion of the
                  order.<br><br>
                  The client is responsible for supplying of the correct details allowing the company to satisfy itself
                  the client is and the payment details are genuine. We provide our clients the facility to communicate
                  directly with our writers via their official unique ID numbers which are assigned to each writer by
                  the company.<br><br>
                  <i><b>Please Note:</b> No other communication method is allowed – telephonic (landline or mobile) or
                    any other electronic method example, but not limited to Facebook and is strictly forbidden. This is
                    to assure the identity of both client and writer. If Assign Up finds that communication has taken
                    place between the writer and client outside of the official communication channel, then Assign Up
                    without notice will terminate the clients order without further notice and they will be excluded
                    from using our services in the future.</i>

                  When placing an order with Assign Up the client will have to provide all information like, email
                  address, postal address, contact phone accurately as this information will also be crossed referenced
                  with client payment information. Failure to provide original information will result in the order not
                  being fulfilled, which in turn means the order / contract will be cancelled.<br><br>
                  When placing the order the client will need to briefly describe the requirements of the paper and to
                  also attach all the extra relevant information, documents, which may be helpful to the writer to
                  understand the topic. Furthermore if the client has library access, then customer can provide the
                  library access details so the writer who may get any information required to complete the assignment,
                  however providing library access is totally optional and is not a pre-requisite for the paper
                  completion. The client has the right to not disclose library access details. In this case the writer
                  will get all the information related to the course for themselves.<br><br>
                  In the Event the sources required for the production of your paper by the writer are rare, obscure,
                  not open sourced, or readily available to the general public, it is the responsibility of the client
                  to provide those materials at the time you place your order. Failure to do so will inhibit the writer
                  meeting delivery deadlines for the final paper, thus failure to comply with these terms and conditions
                  we may in its sole discretion take whatever action deemed necessary to address said violation,
                  including but not limited to, refusal to complete your order at all within the agreed time frame,
                  refusal to fully comply with agreed page requirements of your order, and/or refusal to offer free
                  revisions and/or refund.<br><br>
                  The client is required to pay the full amount of the order in advance through our own secure online
                  web payment system.<br><br>
                  We will accept available precautions to protect your personal information from unauthorised access,
                  use or disclosure. We will use encrypted security protocols (SSL) to protect your payment and personal
                  information.<br><br>
                  As soon as the company receives the payment from the client, a writer is assigned to work on the
                  paper. The client can ask the writer questions directly, these questions have to relate to the paper
                  being written and also must be communicated through the prescribed company communication route. If the
                  client is not happy with the writer assigned, then the client can request for the writer to be changed
                  from customer support.

                  Assign Up is committed to provide the services requested by the client either on time or if possible
                  before the agreed date, barring any case such as storms, or other natural disaster making it
                  impossible to honour our delivery pledge.<br><br>

                  When providing Assign Up with client order form information, if it does not correspond to the payment
                  information, or the client decides to change the writer at the last minute then this can result in
                  paper deadline being missed; but it is our promise that if the client has engaged our services
                  correctly then we will ensure the paper is delivered on time.<br><br>

                  When the client places an order with Assign Up and a date is agreed, it will always be as “Business
                  Working Days”, so if the company states 3 days, then this will mean 3 business working days, which are
                  Monday to Fridays and does not include Saturday and Sunday.<br><br>

                  When the writer has finished the requested paper, the client will be sent an alert email informing
                  them that the paper is ready for downloading from our website. It is the clients’ responsibility to
                  check the final paper and that they are happy. If Assign Up does not hear from the client 24 hours (1
                  Day) after the final paper was downloaded, then Assign Up will take it that the client is happy with
                  the final paper.
